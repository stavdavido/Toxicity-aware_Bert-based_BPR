#The code is organized into three separate directories, each with a specific purpose:
#The Baselines folder holds the code used to run experiments with baseline models for comparison.
#The Data Preprocessing folder contains notebooks that are responsible for creating and preparing the datasets that serve as input to the main model.
#The ToxicFreeMed folder contains the source code for the primary, proposed model itself.
